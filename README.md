# Bank-Marketing-Subscription-Prediction-End-to-End-ML-Project-
This project predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit (`y = yes/no`) based on their personal and campaign-related data.   The goal is to help marketing teams target potential customers efficiently while understanding the drivers behind each prediction using explainable AI (SHAP).
